`python-lang-project-harness` is designed to be loaded by downstream Python
projects as a test/dev dependency. The pytest surface has two supported entry
points: an auto-loaded pytest plugin and an explicit test helper.

## Dev Dependency Plugin

Add the package to the downstream test dependency group together with pytest:

```toml
[dependency-groups]
test = [
  "pytest>=8",
  "python-lang-project-harness>=0.1.0",
]

[tool.pytest.ini_options]
addopts = ["--python-project-harness"]
```

The distribution exposes this plugin entry point:

```toml
[project.entry-points.pytest11]
python_lang_project_harness = "python_lang_project_harness.pytest_plugin"
```

Pytest auto-loads the plugin when the package is installed, but the harness is
quiet unless `--python-project-harness` is enabled. This keeps the package safe
as a normal library dependency while making the policy gate easy to opt into
from pytest config.

Supported plugin options:

- `--python-project-harness`: collect and run one harness item.
- `--python-project-harness-root PATH`: choose the project root; defaults to
  pytest `rootdir`.
- `--python-project-harness-no-tests`: skip parsing test files while still
  evaluating tests-root layout.
- `--python-project-harness-source-dir NAME`: add one source root name; can be
  repeated.
- `--python-project-harness-test-dir NAME`: add one test root name; can be
  repeated.
- `--python-project-harness-extra-path NAME`: add one extra project path; can
  be repeated.
- `--python-project-harness-error-only`: fail only on parser errors.
- `--python-project-harness-no-advice`: hide non-blocking advice in assertion
  output.

## Explicit Test Helper

Projects that prefer a committed test file can mount the same runner directly:

```python
from python_lang_project_harness.pytest import python_project_harness_test

test_python_project_harness_policy = python_project_harness_test()
```

The helper defaults to `Path(".")` and returns a pytest-collectable callable.
Callers can pass the same project-scope options used by the library runner:

```python
from python_lang_parser import PythonDiagnosticSeverity
from python_lang_project_harness.pytest import python_project_harness_test

test_python_project_harness_policy = python_project_harness_test(
    source_dir_names=("lib",),
    include_tests=False,
    severities=frozenset({PythonDiagnosticSeverity.ERROR}),
)
```

Both pytest entry points call the parser-backed project runner. They do not own
Python parsing, source scanning semantics, or policy-specific AST logic.
