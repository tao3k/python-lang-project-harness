# asp-python

`asp-python` is a standalone Python policy and semantic tooling library for
modern Python packages. It ships two library boundaries in one repo:

- `python_lang_parser`: Python-native AST, compiler, tokenize, symbol-table,
  module-shape, public-surface, and symbol-role facts.
- `asp_python`: project discovery, deterministic rule
  packs, compact rendered diagnostics, and pytest-friendly assertions.

ASP Python is library-first. Callers pass a project root or explicit paths,
then decide whether to assert, render compact text, or inspect the structured
report. Compact text is the default agent repair surface; JSON is available for
tooling through `render_asp_python_report_json()`.

`python_lang_parser` is the semantic foundation. ASP Python policy consumes parser
reports and parser-owned `pyproject.toml` metadata instead of re-parsing Python
source or guessing package scope in the rule layer; tests-root layout stays in
ASP Python.

## Quick Use

```python
from pathlib import Path

from asp_python import (
    __version__,
    PythonOwnerResponsibility,
    PythonVerificationProfileHint,
    PythonVerificationTaskKind,
    assert_asp_python_clean,
    default_asp_python_config,
    plan_python_project_verification_with_config,
    render_asp_python_report,
    render_python_reasoning_tree,
    render_python_verification_plan,
    run_asp_python,
)


def test_asp_python_policy() -> None:
    assert_asp_python_clean(Path("."))


report = run_asp_python(Path("."))
print(__version__)
print(render_asp_python_report(report))
print(render_python_reasoning_tree(report))
```

The project runner scans the whole Python project root by default, excluding
tool/cache/build directories such as `.venv`, `__pycache__`, `build`, and
`dist`. Conventional source and test roots still classify project policy, but
they do not narrow parser coverage. The explicit path runner,
`run_asp_python_paths([...])`, is useful for focused parser and syntax
checks.
Use `AspPythonConfig` to change source-root classification, test-root
classification, extra external project paths, test inclusion, or blocking
severities without hardcoding project-specific policy into the library.
Project runners also read `[tool.asp-python]` from
`pyproject.toml` when no explicit `AspPythonConfig` is passed, including
`disabled_rule_ids` and `blocking_rule_ids` for stable rule-id policy.
Standard `[project]` metadata such as `name`, `requires-python`,
`import-names`, scripts, and pytest entry points is parsed by
`python_lang_parser` and appears in project policy and reasoning-tree facts.
When `include_tests=False`, test files are not parsed, but tests-root layout
policy still runs. Explained local exceptions can live in
`tests/asp-python-rules.toml`.

For agent repair loops, `render_python_reasoning_tree(report)` emits a compact
package/module owner tree from parser-owned facts. It shows package branches,
public/internal leaves, compact export names, child names, internal import
edges, declared project import names, entry points, package roots, and owner
shadows without forcing an LLM to consume the full JSON report first. In
project-scoped runs, tree paths are rendered relative to the project root to
avoid repeating long absolute prefixes.

`render_asp_python_agent_snapshot(".")` bundles compact policy
findings, reasoning-tree facts, verification-profile reminders, and active
verification tasks into one low-noise library response. The snapshot uses
capped module summaries, branches, public owners, import edges, and
branch-first profile candidates.

The provider console script exposes Query and registry surfaces. Public source
discovery is owned by the Runtime Search Playbook. Policy remains a dependency
API consumed by pytest/build ownership:

```shell
asp search playbook --language python --rg -n -e AspPythonReport . --tantivy 'title:AspPythonReport^2 OR body:AspPythonReport'
asp query playbook --language python --selector '<python-selector>' --projection source --workspace .
asp-python agent doctor --json .
asp-python agent guide .
python -c 'from asp_python import assert_asp_python_clean; assert_asp_python_clean(".")'
```

## Verification Planning

Verification is a library-first Agent contract. ASP Python does not execute
benchmark, security, stress, or chaos tools. It plans parser-backed obligations
that external skills can satisfy with receipts or complete waivers:

```python
config = default_asp_python_config().with_verification_profile_hint(
    PythonVerificationProfileHint(
        "src/pkg/api.py",
        (PythonOwnerResponsibility.PUBLIC_API,),
    )
    .with_task_kinds((PythonVerificationTaskKind.SECURITY,))
    .with_rationale("this public API needs a security review")
)
plan = plan_python_project_verification_with_config(Path("."), config)
print(render_python_verification_plan(plan))
```

Profile hints, dependency signals, receipts, waivers, task-kind mappings, and
skill bindings are configurable through `PythonVerificationPolicy` or
`[tool.asp-python.verification]`. Parser facts win over config
hints; mismatches become `responsibility_review` tasks instead of silent trust.
`build_python_verification_profile_index(...)` exposes `active_profile_hints()`
so Agents can turn parser-suggested owners into config-ready verification
hints. Public package branches aggregate child-module public API signals, so
large packages surface owner decisions instead of one reminder per file. Report
helpers can render or persist `verification_plan.json`,
`verification_task_index.json`, and `performance_index.json` obligations; source
manifests list only source-baseline artifacts, while runtime manifests carry
the complete bundle with `project_root`.
Profile drift output includes both configured and parser-suggested
responsibilities.

## Pytest Dev Dependency

Downstream projects can load ASP Python through their test/dev dependency
group:

```toml
[dependency-groups]
test = [
  "pytest>=8",
  "asp-python[pytest]>=0.1.0",
]

[tool.pytest.ini_options]
addopts = ["--asp-python"]
```

The pytest plugin is exposed through the package `pytest11` entry point. It is
loaded by pytest when the dev dependency is installed, but it only runs the
ASP Python policy gate when `--asp-python` is enabled. Projects that prefer an
explicit test file can use the public helper:

```python
from asp_python.pytest import asp_python_test

test_asp_python_policy = asp_python_test()
```

## Rule Packs

Default project execution runs these packs in order:

1. `python.syntax`
2. `python.project_policy`
3. `python.modern_design`
4. `python.modularity`
5. `python.test_layout`
6. `python.agent_policy`

`Warning` and `Error` findings block assertions by default. `Info` findings,
including `PY-AGENT-*` advice, stay visible in compact diagnostics without
blocking unless a caller opts into stricter severities.

The modularity pack uses parser-owned mixed signals. `PY-MOD-R006` does not
fail a file for line count alone; it requires the effective-line budget plus a
long function span or multiple split indicators such as wide public surface,
many top-level items, or mixed responsibility groups.

Agent advice also uses package-tree facts. Broad non-facade branch packages get
owner-map advice when child count combines with public-child or effective-line
signals, which helps agents see folder-level responsibility drift during
coding without changing default blocking behavior.

Detailed package material lives under [`docs/`](docs/index.md).

## CI

GitHub Actions runs the package contract on every pull request and on pushes to
the default branch: `uv sync --group test --locked`, ruff format/check, pytest,
ASP Python self-check, agent snapshot, wheel/sdist build, and diff hygiene.
